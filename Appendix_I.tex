\section{Introduction}
Here we go... decomposition methodologies available in the literature. Moreover, it also contains algorithms for snowpack parameters estimation from single, dual and full- polarimetric SAR data. 

\section{Functionalities}
Many pre and post-processing steps are included along with the snowpack parameter estimation algorithms in this HimSAR toolbox.
