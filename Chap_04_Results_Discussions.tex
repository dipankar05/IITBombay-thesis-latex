\chapter{Results and Discussions}
\label{sec:4}
In this Chapter, the results obtained from all the algorithms are presented in separate sub-sections along with the detailed investigations using topographic and observatory measurements. Multi-temporal analyses of the results are also presented. 
\section{Snow wetness from dual polarimetric data}
\FloatBarrier
In this section, the results obtained from the proposed snow wetness estimation method for dual-polarimetric coherent (HH/VV) SAR data (\emph{i.e.,} TerraSAR-X)~\cref{sec:3} are presented.
