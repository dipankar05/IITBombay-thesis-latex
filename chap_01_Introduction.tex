Snow is classified as wet or dry depending upon the amount of liquid water content. Dry snow consists of ice particles and air, whereas wet snow contains liquid water as a third component. Microwaves strongly respond to this change in liquid water content in snow~\citep{hallikainen1986dielectric}. The estimation of snowpack parameters requires a good understanding of the scattering mechanisms from the snowpack. Scattering from the air-snow surface and the uppermost layers are effective for wet snow estimation. The attenuation of a propagating EM wave is given in terms of the volume extinction coefficient ($\kappa_e$) and the penetration depth is defined as, $\delta_{p}=1/\kappa_e$. 



\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SAR polarimetry is a very active research area in radar remote sensing in which there is an increased need to explore the potential for quantitative estimation of bio-/geo-physical parameters.
	
	\item Many works have reported the study of snow parameters using SAR data, among which very few studies barely attempted to retrieve any quantitative (for example snow wetness, snow density, snow grain size etc.) information.
	
	\item There is no proven precise methodology for the estimation of snowpack parameters using full polarimetric SAR data over the Indian Himalayan region. 
	
	\item The data obtained from the new generation advanced full-polarimetric SAR sensors along with the advanced polarimetric decomposition techniques, provide an opportunity to develop improved algorithms for snow pack parameters estimation. 
	
\end{itemize}
\section{Research objectives}
In this thesis, polarimetric SAR data is used for the estimation of snowpack parameters over the Indian Himalayan region. In this context algorithms have been developed for the estimation of snow wetness, snow surface dielectric constant and density,
\begin{description}
	\item[$\mbox{1(a)}.$ ] Estimation of snow wetness from dual polarimetric $(\mbox{HH}+\mbox{VV})$ coherent X-band data.
	\item[$\mbox{1(b)}.$ ] Estimation of snow wetness from full polarimetric $(\mbox{HH}+\mbox{HV}+\mbox{VH}+\mbox{VV})$ SAR data.
	\item[$\mbox{1(c)}.$ ] Estimation of snow surface dielectric constant from full polarimetric $(\mbox{HH}+\mbox{HV}+\mbox{VH}+\mbox{VV})$ SAR data.

%\item Development of an algorithm for estimation of snow density from full polarimetric $(\mbox{HH}+\mbox{HV}+\mbox{VH}+\mbox{VV})$ Radarsat-2 (5.4 GHz) data.
%\end{enumerate} 

These objectives are accomplished and implemented over the Indian Himalayan region for which data is acquired over the study area and field measurements were recorded during January to March 2012-2014. In the Indian Himalayan region, snowfall normally occurs during December to March from an altitude of 2000 m above the mean sea level. The expected snow wetness during Jan.-- Feb. is around 2--6 $\%$ by volume because of fresh snowfall and average minimum temperature. The snow density variation mainly depends on the temperature which produces the snow melt-freeze cycle. In the Indian Himalayan region, the mean minimum temperature in the month of January is around -15$^\circ$C-0$^\circ$C and the mean maximum temperature in the month of June is around 20$^\circ$C-30$^\circ$C. The mean high and low temperatures in the month of February over the study area are around 11$^\circ$C  and -1$^\circ$C respectively.
